# Setup the environment for notebooks

ðŸš¨ **Important** ðŸš¨

- The folder **notebooks/** needs to be the root of your vscode workspace
- Open directly this folder **notebooks/**, not the parent folder **experiment-ai.model**

Activate (start using) the environment. To be able to install packages inside folder.

`pip --verseion`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

_If doesn't work try the force command. **-U** = update if it had already installed_

`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
